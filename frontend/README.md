🚀 Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

      cd library-system/frontend

Open index.html in your browser.

Ensure the backend server is running (e.g., http://localhost:3000) so API requests function correctly.

🔗 Backend Integration

This frontend communicates with the backend built using:
        
        NestJS
        
        MongoDB (Mongoose)
        
        RESTful API architecture
        
        Handles JWT authentication and role-based authorization

Make sure the backend is running before testing features like login, borrowing, or downloading e-books.
